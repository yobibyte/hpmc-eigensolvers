## Measuring performance of eigensolvers for small tridiagonal symmetric eigenproblems.

### Intro

### What eigensolvers we are interested in?

* DSTEQR
* DSTEVX
* DSTEMR

Table from the http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lawnspdf/lawn183.pdf here.

### Important stuff

* matrices are synthetic
* only one architecture + tech specs
